# What Would You Say You Do Here?

## What Even Is a Staff Engineer?

* Senior level is "anchor" level for a career ladder. Levels below are for people to grow their autonomy; the levels above increase impact and responsibility.
* Senior is sometimes seen as the "tenure" level.
* Staff is the first rung of the "technical leadership" levels.
* Titles do matter.

## Why Do We Need Engineers Who Can See the Big Picture?

* Good decisions need *context*.
* The local maximum problem. Solved with decision makers (or decision influencers) who can take an outside view; consider the goals of multiple teams at once and choose a path that's best for the whole org or the whole business.
* Need to also anticipate how the decision will play out in the future (i.e., forward-looking decisions).
* Managers and CTO may not be best-fitted to be such decision makers because management authority can overshadow technical judgement and managing others is a full-time job.

## Why Do We Need Engineers Who Lead Projects That Cross Multiple Teams?

* Mention of bias to postpone or hand-wave the key decisions that need the most alignment.
* Solution is to have someone who feels ownership for the whole thing, rather than any of its individual parts. They scope out the work, build a proposal, author high-level system design, serve as a contact point for it, maintain high engineering standard, anticipate risks, ask hard questions. Informally mentor or coach other leads, unblock project. Telling the story of what's happening and why, selling the vision, explaining what the work will achieve.
* TPMs are responsible for delivery, not design and engineering quality.

## Why Do We Need Engineers Who Are a Good Influence?

* Staff Engineers are role models.
* Vocally celebrate other people's work, treat each other with respect, ask clarifying questions.

## You're Not a Manager, but You are a Leader

* Staff engineering is a leadership role.
* Projects that can't succeed without collaboration, communication, and alignment.
* Reference [Kind Engineering](https://kind.engineering/).

## You're in a "Technical" Role

* Deeply specialized leadership role.

## You Aim to Be Autonomous

* Your manager brings you information and shares context, but you should be telling them what's important just as much as the other way around.
* Reference [So You're Staff+ ... Now What?](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/so-youre-staff-now-what).

## You Set Technical Direction

* Job is not to come up with all (or even any) of the aspects of the technical direction, but to ensure there is an agreed-upon, well-understood solution that solves the problems it sets out to solve.

## You Communicate Often and Well

## Where in the Organization Do You Sit?

* Reporting chains affect level of support, information you're privy to, how you're perceived by colleagues outside your group.

### Reporting "high"

* Broad perspective.
* Info will be high-level and impactful, and so will the problems you're asked to solve.
* Manager will have less time, visibility, less likely to be your advocate or help you grow.

### Reporting "low"

* Manager will have more time, more likely to be an advocate, but less experienced.
* May find it hard to influence the org.
* Info will be filtered, centered on the problems of the specific team.
* Reference [When your manager isn't supporting you, build a voltron](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-voltron/)

## What's Your Scope?

* Inside your scope, you should have some influence on short-term and long-term goals. You should be aware of the major decisions being made.
* Get very clear on what your scope is, even if it's temporary or subject to change.

### A scope too broad

* Lack of impact
* Becoming a bottleneck
* Decision fatigue
* Missing relationships

### A scope too narrow

* Lack of impact
* Opportunity cost
* Overshadowing other engineers
* Over-engineering

## What Shape Is Your Role?

### Do you approach things depth-first or breadth-first?

* Very much about your personality and work style.

### Which of the "four disciplines" do you gravitate toward?

* Reference [Role and Influence: The IC trajectory beyond Staff](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/role-and-influence-ic-trajectory-beyond-staff).
* Core technical skills
* Product management
* Project management
* People management

### How much do you want (or need) to code?

* If you're going to feel antsy unless you're in code every day, make sure you're not taking on a broad architectural or influence-based role where you just won't have time.
* Or at least have a plan for how you're going to scratch that itch, so you'll be able to resist jumping on coding tasks and leaving the bigger problems to fend for themselves.

### How's your delayed gratification?

* Ask a manager who you trust to tell you, regularly and honestly, how things are going.

### Are you keeping one foot on the manager track?

* Tech lead manager (TLM).

### Do any of these archetypes fit you?

* Reference [Staff Archetypes](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes)
* Tech leads
* Architects
* Solvers
* Right hands

## What's Your Primary Focus?

* Most times you'll have autonomy in deciding what's important.

### What's important?

* Everything you do has a high opportunity cost, so your work needs to be important.

### What needs you?

## Aligning on Scope, Shape, and Primary Focus

* Write out your understanding of the job and share it with your manager.

## Is That Your Job?

* Your job is to make your organization successful (i.e., achieve its goals).

# Three Maps

* Locator map, topographical map, treasure map.

## Locator map

* Risks: prioritizing badly, losing empathy, tuning out the background noise (i.e., boiling frog), forgetting what the work is for.

### Seeing bigger

* Taking an outsider view
* Escaping the echo chamber. Seek out peers in other groups and build relationship with other roles (product, customer support, etc.)
* What's actually important?
* What do your customers care about? Reference to [No User Left Behind: Making Sure Customers Reach Your Service](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program/presentation/suley)
* Have your problems been solved before? Take the time to understand what already exists before building something new.

## Topographical Map

### Rought Terrain

* Your good ideas don't get traction
* You don't find out about the difficult parts until you get there
* Everything takes longer

### Understanding Your Organization

#### What's the culture?

* Statement of values or principles are aspirational.
* The real values of the company are reflected in what actually happens every day.
* Secret or open?
* Oral or written?
* Top-down or bottom-up?
* Fast change or deliberate change? Tied to written and oral culture.
* Back channels or front doors?
* Allocated or available?
* Liquid or crystallized? Mention of projects earmarked for promotion and ruffling feathers.

#### Power, rules, or mission?

* Reference to [A typology of organisational cultures](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/13/suppl_2/ii22.short)
* Pathological: preoccupation with personal power, needs, and glory
* Bureaucratic: preoccupation with rules, positions, and departamental turf
* Generative: concentration of the mission itself
* Good practices: blameless postmortems, encouraging experimentation, taking calculated risks, breaking down silos.

#### Noticing the points of interest

* Chasms
* Fortresses
* Disputed territory
* Uncrossable deserts
* Paved roads, shortcuts, and long ways around

### What Points of Interest Are on Your Map?

#### How are decisions made?

#### Where is "the room"?

* Ask someone you trust to walk you through where a particular decision came from.

#### Asking to join in

* Show how including you will make your organization better at achieving its goals.
* Reference to [Getting in the Room](https://lethain.com/getting-in-the-room/).

#### The shadow org chart

* Reference to [Debugging Teams](https://book.debuggingteams.com/#manipulating_your_organization)

### Keeping Your Topographic Map Up to Date

* Automated announcement lists and channels
* Walking the floor
* Lurking
* Making time for reading
* Checking in with your leadership
* Talking with people

### If the Terrain Is Still Difficult to Navigate, Be a Bridge

## The Treasure Map

### Chasing Shiny Things

* It'll be harder to keep everyone going in the same direction
* You won't finish big things
* You'll accumulate cruft
* You'll have competing initiatives
* Engineers stop growing

### Taking a Longer View

#### Why are you doing whatever you're doing?

* Civilization video game analogy.

#### Sharing the map

* Where we are, where we're going, why we're taking the steps that we are along the way.

### If the Treasure Map Is Still Unclear, It Might Be Time to Draw a New One

## Your Personal Journey

* As a staff engineer, it can take longer to see the impact of your work.
* Looking back, you should have a narrative of what you were trying to achieve and how it went.
* Looking ahead, you should have a story of what you are trying to do.
* Trail map coming up in Chapter 9.

# Creating the Big Picture

## What's a Vision? What's a Strategy?

* "tragedy of the commons", another idiom for local maximum

### What's a Technical Vision?

* A technical vision describes the future as you'd like it to be once the objectives have been achieved and the biggest problems are solved.
* Also called a "north star".
* If you could wave a magic wand and be done, what would your architecture, processes, teams, culture, or capabilities be? That's your vision.

### What's a Technical Strategy?

* A strategy is a plan of action. It's how you intend to achieve your goals, navigating past the obstacles you'll meet along the way.
* It should bring clarity -- not about the destination, but about the path there.
* At it's kernel, it is a diagnosis of the problems, a guiding policy, and actions that will bypass the challenges.

#### The diagnosis

* Find patterns in the noise or using metaphors or mental models to make the problem easy to understand.
* This is difficult. It will take time.

#### Guiding policy

* The guiding policy is your approach to bypassing the obstacles described in the diagnosis.

#### Coherent actions

* Once you've got a diagnosis and guiding policy, you can get specific about the actions you're going to take and the ones you won't.
* A strategy should draw on your advantages.
* A strategy that can't get staffed in your organization is a waste of time.

### Do You Really Need Vision and Strategy Documents?

* If it's easy to describe the state that you're trying to get to or the problem you're trying to solve, what you actually want might be more like the goals section of a design document, or even the description of a pull request.
* Writing technical vision or strategy takes time. If you can achieve the same outcome in a more lightweight way, do that instead.

## The Approach

* There will be a ton of preparation, then a ton of iteration and alignment.
* The agreeement is the work.
* Mention of technology radar.

### Embrace the Boring Ideas

* Be prepared for your work to involve existing ideas, not brand-new ones.
* Someone who's willing to weight up all the possible solutions, make the case for what to do and not do, align everyone, and be brave enough to make the (potentially wrong) decisions.

### Join an Expedition in Progress

* Share the lead
* Follow their lead
* Step away

### Get a Sponsor

* A sponsor needs the power to decide what an organization spends time and staffing on, and such decisions are usually up to the local director or VP.
* A sponsor helps clarify and justify the work, adds hierarchy to groups that would otherwise get stuck at attempting consensus, set success criteria and act as a tiebreaker when decisions are stuck in committee.
* Mention of "objectives that are always true".

### Choose Your Core Group

* Working with other people gives you accountability.
* Aim to recruit a small core group (2-4 people) to help you create the document, as well as a broader group of general allies and supporters.
* Outside of the core team, you can offer more lightweight involvement: you'll interview them, try to represent their point of view in your work, and let them review early drafts.
* Lead vs. first among equals.

### Set Scope

* Consider how much the problems you are trying to solve sprawl across the organization.

### Make Sure It's Achievable

* Talk with someone who's done something similar before.

### Make It Official

Checklist:
* We need this.
* I know the solution will be boring and obvious.
* There isn't an existing effort (or I've joined it).
* There's organizational support.
* We agree on what we're creating.
* The problem is solvable (by me).
* I'm not lying to myself on any of the above.

## The Writing

### The Writing Loop

* Timebox this work and give yourself some deadlines.
* If you've set up milestones, use them as a reminder to stop iterating and wrap up.

#### Initial Ideas

* What documents already exist? "Inherit" any constraints they've set.
* What needs to change? Mention of "architectural characteristics".
* What's great as it is?
* What's important?
* What will Future You wish that Present You had done?

#### Writing

* Have the leader write a first draft for discussion.
* Aggregate multiple first drafts.

#### Interviews

* Put your preconceptions aside and talk to people. Lots of people.

#### Thinking

* Give yourself a lot of time to do that.
* Be open to shift in your thinking.
* Bias to describe a problem in terms of a solution you've already chosen.

### Make Decisions

#### Trade-offs

* Compare two positive attributes of the outcomes you want.

#### Building consensus

* Don't block on full consensus; lack of disagreement is more important than agreement.

#### Not deciding is a decision (just usually not a good one)

* Decisions constrain possibilities and make it possible to make progress.
* Remember that you don't need to make the best decision, just a good enough decision.

#### Show your work

* Document the decision, including the trade-offs you considered and how you got to the decision in the end.

### Get Aligned and Stay Aligned

#### Be Reasonable

* Mention of the "Overton window".

#### Nemawashi

* Mention of "nemawashi"; sharing information and laying the foundations so that by the time a decision is made, there's already consensus of opinion.

#### Work on your story

* You want a story that is comprehensible, relatable, and comfortable.

### Create the Final Draft

* Not everyone will be excited to review.
* Think about how you can make it easy to read, or share the highlights in another way.

## The Launch

### Make It Official

### Keep It Fresh

* Be prepared to revisit your document.
